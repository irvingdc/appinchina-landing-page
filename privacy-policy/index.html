		<div class="policy-container">

			<h3>Personal Information Collection</h3>
			<p>AppInChina may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future. Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by AppInChina. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, the quality maintenance of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the AppInChina website. AppInChina encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from AppInChina so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. AppInChina is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the AppInChina website.</p>

			<h3>Personal Information Usage</h3>
			<p>AppInChina collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested. AppInChina may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from AppInChina and its partners. AppInChina may also contact you via questionnaires to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
			<br/><br/>
			AppInChina does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
			<br/><br/>
			AppInChina may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) will not be transferred to the third party. AppInChina may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to AppInChina, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. AppInChina may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within AppInChina, in order to determine what AppInChina services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within AppInChina to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. AppInChina will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on AppInChina or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of AppInChina; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of AppInChina, or the public.</p>

			<h3>Cookies Usage</h3>
			<p>The AppInChina website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
			<br/>
			One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize AppInChina pages, or register with AppInChina site or services, a cookie helps AppInChina to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same AppInChina website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the AppInChina features that you customized.
			<br/>
			You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the AppInChina services or websites you visit. AppInChina will protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
			</p>

			<h3>Children Thirteen and Under</h3>
